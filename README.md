# My Awesome Joke Teller Web App

Welcome to my Joke Teller web app â€“ the laughter generator with a twist! This project utilizes APIs to fetch either dark or programming jokes and then delivers them in a unique way by having a robotic voice speak them out. With a sleek and user-friendly UI adorned with a charming robot gif, get ready to giggle with just a click of a button.

## How It's Made:

**Tech Stack:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
**API** jokeapi, Speech Synthesis API.

I crafted this project by integrating front-end technologies, bringing together a seamless blend of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript to handle the dynamic functionalities. The core of the hilarity lies in the integration with jokeapi, Speech Synthesis API, which fetches jokes based on user preferences. The charming UI is designed to enhance the user experience, with a lively robot gif providing the illusion of the jokes being spoken by a playful companion.

## Optimizations:

In the quest for excellence, this project underwent several optimizations to ensure not just a visually appealing product but an efficient one too. Notable optimizations is the code refactoring. These enhancement not only make the app more performant but also serve as valuable talking points in technical interviews.

## Lessons Learned:

Embarking on this project was a journey of continuous learning and discovery. From navigating API integrations to refining the UI for a delightful user experience, each step offered insights and moments of triumph. A key lesson was the functions running in the wrong other opposed to how i laid it out in the flowchart. I made some errors which i was able to fix shortly after highlighting the adaptability and problem-solving skills honed during the development process.

Feel free to explore the codebase, and may your days be filled with laughter and learning!
